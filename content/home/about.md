# Biography

I am currently working as an operations engineer at M\*Modal. An average day at work can vary quite a bit. For example, One day I can be working on implementing a Prometheus monitoring system and experimenting with Kubernetes and Docker, while another I will be building a web application in Go. Because of the topic of my work can be different every day, I am able to learn and experiment with a wide array of technologies and tools. Outside of work I enjoy exploring a wide variety of topics ranging from amazon web services to graph based database systems like Neo4J. For a more complete description of what I do, be sure to check out my work experience and poject sections.
