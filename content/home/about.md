# Biography

I am currently working as an operations engineer at M\*Modal. An average day at work can vary quite a bit. For example, One day I can be working on implementing a Prometheus monitoring system and experimenting with Kubernetes and Docker, while another I will be building a web application in Golang. Because of the topic of my work can be different every day, I am able to learn and experiment with a wide array of technologies and tools. Outside of work I enjoy exploring areas outside of those at work to find projects. Most recently I have taken up the book "Hacking: The Art Of Exploitation" to learn more about C, x86 assembly, and reverese engineering. Following this book I plan to move onto books such as Pracical Malware Analysis and Malware Analysts Cookbook.
