My senior capstone project at westminster is a full penetration test of the college unix lab, due to the sensitive matter of the data found, the information published here will be restricted. The scope of this project is currently focused on the lab's network, and not on the college's network as a whole. This means that I will be focusing on the virtual lan on which the linux lab resides. This project has given me the opportunity to take a look at a variaty of services and systems and test for vulnerabilities. I will update the list below as I use different techniques and test different aspects of the lab.

##Man in the Middle

The first thing that my adviser and I wanted to look at is what an attacker could pick up by intercepting packets sent to and from a machine. 
**This project is still in progress! check back later for new updates!h
